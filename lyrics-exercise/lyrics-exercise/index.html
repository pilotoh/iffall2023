        I got a bad disease
        Out from my brain is where I bleed
        Insanity it seems
        Has got me by my soul to squeeze
        With all the love from me
        With all the dyin' trees, I scream
        The angels in my dream, yeah
        Had turned to demons of greed, that's mean
    </p>
    <p>
        Where I go, I just don't know
        I got to, got to, gotta take it slow
        When I find my peace of mind
        I'm gonna give you some of my good time
    </p>

    <p>
        Today love smiled on me
        He took away my pain, said, "Please"
        "I'll let your ride be free"
        "You gotta let it be, oh, yeah"
    </p>
    <p>
        Where I go, I just don't know
        I got to, gotta, gotta take it slow
        When I find my peace of mind
        I'm gonna give ya some of my good time
    </p>
    <p>
        Yeah!
    </p>
    <p>
        Oh, so polite indeed
        Well, I got everything I need
        I'll make my days a breeze
        And take away my self-destruction
    </p>

  <p>
        It's bitter baby and it's very sweet
        Holy rollercoaster, but I'm on my feet
        Take me to the river, let me on your shore
        I'll be comin' back maybe, I'll be comin' back for more
        Doo-doo dingle zing a dong bone
        Ba-di ba-da ba-zumba crunga cong gone bad
        I could not forget, but I will not endeavor
        Simple pleasures are much better but I won't regret it never
    </p>
    <p>
        Where I go, I just don't know
        I got to, got to, gotta take it slow
        When I find my peace of mind
        I'm gonna give you some of my good time
    </p>
    <p>
        Where I go, I just don't know
        I might end up somewhere in Mexico
        When I find my peace of mind
        I'm gonna keep ya for the end of time
    </p>

    <h4>
        About
    </h4>


    Originally recorded during the production of their fifth studio album, Blood Sugar Sex Magik (1991). Although it
    was not featured on the record and compiled as a b side to Give It Away and Under the Bridge, Soul to
    Squeeze was later released as a single in 1993 to coincide with its inclusion on the Coneheads film soundtrack,
    a soundtrack which predominantly contained previously released B Sides from Warner artists, and was eventually
    re released for the 2003 Greatest Hits album. It can also be found on the bands Live Rare Remix Box and The
    Plasma Shaft.

    The song became an unexpected success when it peaked at number one on the U.S. Modern Rock Tracks, where it
    remained for 5 non-consecutive weeks making it only the second number one for the band following Give It Away.
    The single also peaked at number twenty-two on the Hot 100 and number seven on the Mainstream Rock chart.[1]

    “Soul to Squeeze” remains one of the bands most popular songs. It made its live debut in 1998 when John
    Frusciante returned to the band and has been heavily played on every tour since then.
