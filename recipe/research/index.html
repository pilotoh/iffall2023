        <br>I believe this website is very clear and easy to navigate  the steps are eady and it does not ovely complicate. It has reviews, nutrition info and notes. I do wish that it could be adjusted based on the servings and there were more images or a vides to visually aid the cooking process   <br>
        
        <span class="bolded">source:</span><a href="https://www.seriouseats.com/""> Serious Eats</a> <br>
        I like how in the site you can filter by ingredient, cuisine, diet, course or season...that is very impressive. Although, I feel that initially i felt a bit overwhelemd by their layout and type choices- does not seem like a traditional recipe site. Overall, very usefull site, no paywalls and a tn of recipes! <br>

        <span class="bolded"> source:</span><a href="https://damndelicious.net/"> Damn Delicous</a> <br>
        This site is a bit elagant initally. They follow a black and white color palette and seem like a fancy steak resurtants menu. They highlight meals which is convienent and have a jump to recipe button which makes life easier. their use of photos is really great. They do kind of have a bit of ads which can get annoyin. but overall, very impressive, organzied and aesthetic.<br>

        <span class="bolded"> source:</span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/"> Yotube</a> <br>
        I think youtube has alot of information and channels that is easy to navigate. Additionaly, it has many filters such as 'shorts' 'library' 'home' and shows your prefrences on top bar and home page. <br>

        <span class="bolded"> source:</span><a href="https://www.chefannfoundation.org/knowledge-center/home-recipes?gclid=EAIaIQobChMI4oaN3ce1gQMVU__jBx3NXwmJEAAYAiAAEgKqP_D_BwE"> Chef Ann Foudation</a> <br>
        I appreciate fow they use little icons to demonstrate the type of recipe it is. Additionally I think their color pallete is cohesive and the overall look makes sense.<br>

        <span class="bolded"> source:</span><a href="https://www.sennep.com/">Sennep</a> <br>
       Sennep has very energetic, interactive and colorful design  the motion in their site is fun to look at but can be a bit distracting  Overall though it is a very unique design that is captivating. <br>
