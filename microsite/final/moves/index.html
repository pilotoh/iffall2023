            <h1>Hong 10 Freeze</h1>
            <p>His early teachers taught him to create his own style, instead of looking like other breakers. He's
                carried this mindset with him throughout his breaking career, which has resulted in a number of
                signature moves that he's known for. Some of these moves include his famous 'Hong 10 freeze', a
                variation on an inverted headstand freeze that he made so popular it was named after him.</p>

            <h1>Two Finger Freeze</h1>
            <p>Another is his unbelievable upside down ‘two-fingers freeze', where he uses only two fingers on each hand
                to support his body while freezing upside down. Plus, there are his many variations on the breaking
                power move known as a ‘halo', which is a move that's a mix between a windmill and a head spin.</p>
